## Welcome to the metadata catalog

Nice to see that you would like to want to make your project data findable!

The purpose of this metadata catalog 

- Create clarity and transparency about the data your project used and generated
- Enable you to register your project metadata so that other researchers can find it later on, when they are working on a relevant topic

## Catalog structure

This metadata catalog is based on the STAC framework. STAC works with the following structure

- Catalog
- Catalog
    - Collection
    - Collection
        - Item
        - Item
            - Asset
            - Asset
            

In the context of Deltares, this framework maps like below

- Unit
    - Project
        - Dataset
            - Data asset

```
 ðŸ’¡ Example

 - Hydraulic Engineering [catalog]
    - Project 1112001 [Collection]
        - Dam erosion [Item]
            - Dam erosion 2000-2010 [Asset]
            - Dam erosion 2011-2020 [Asset]
```

## When to register your dataset

- The more data is registered, the harder it becomes to find relevant data.
- Therefore, we ask you to register only the datasets that is used for the â€˜end productâ€™ of your research.
    - This can either be the dataset itself, or a relevant intermediate dataset that is used in the process.
