Every building block or solution can be held against the topics in the graph and this may help in an assessment on the Technical Readiness Level (TRL) it consists. In short TRL describes the maturity of the building block of product by using aspects that are important to manage and maintain the product. Also it becomes clearer that when an improvement should be made to increase the TRL of a building block, what topics are of importance to assess and change.

There are three levels of maturity: low, medium, high. Where low means that the product is new, not general available within Deltares and support non-existent at Deltares. This does not mean that the product itself isn't mature! It means that Deltares has little to none experience with it. Maybe one or two projects make use of the product.

If TRL level is high the product may be called a service that is in ownership of ICT with accompanying support and maintenance. Topdesk is the platform where project leaders and others may request usage. When problems occur an incident call can be made at the Servicedesk ICT. The product is completely implemented into our corporate processes.

With level medium the product is used by some projects but is not available for all colleagues. Support is only within DPT on a personal basis.

Increasing the TRL of a product or building block must be approved by the PO's of DGC and DPT. There may be investments or costs involved, organisational changes implemented and central management and maintenance set up. When all work is done a transition of the product from DPT to ICT finalises the process.

### Terminology explained

**Scope of interest**
What is the scope of use for this product or solution? Only one instance/project of company wide for all colleagues?

**Development Phase**
What is the maturity of the product itself? Is it still in concept phase, a prototype or general available as a product?

**Support**
What is the level of support on this product? On a personal basis or is the product implemented into the organisation?

**Financers**
Who is funding the needed resources for the building block? At TRL low this may be a projects budget, but for TRL high ICT may invest or pay the costs for the organisational funding.

**Repository**
What is the location to get information, leave insights, obtain the product or license of the building block? This may be the Data Management Suite owned by the DPT or Topdesk owned by ICT.

**Functional Management**
Who is responsible for correct working of the building block? Who will you contact in case of failure? DPT or ICT?

*remark*
The term product, solution and building block are used throughout this text. The context may differ, but the way of work is the same for all. Using these different terms is a matter of taste.
