**Description**

Basic storage solution for project related documents. This solution is not suitable for large amount of project data. In case of large files (model and/or observation data), you need to request a p drive.

**When to use**

This folder is the default folder for every approved project (from start of approved proposal phase actually) with a fixed folder structure, which can be modified.

**How to use**

Usage of N drive is very diverse. Most low level is using common windows tools (i.e. Explorer, Total Commander). The environment can easily be accessed via scripting. In all situations counts that you only have access to the N drive when connected to the Deltares HDW Network (either directly or via VPN). It is possible to have a restrictive folder (for projects with restrictions as described in the contract).

**How to get started**

As soon as a project number is requested for in proposal phase this project is automatically created. For a restricted N drive you need to make a topdesk call [here](https://deltares.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/serviceflow?unid=0c49e079b04e47fa8c7e382faf61fea9&from=19ab95f7-c6c4-484b-8278-e0bfe0e6deb6&openedFromService=true).

**Limitations**

Sharing with partners outside Deltares is not possible. Donâ€™t use for large volumes of data.
