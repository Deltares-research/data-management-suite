**Description**

MinIO is cloud storage service that is available on the Deltares private cloud and can be leveraged to share data with external parties / compute locations. MinIO offers a high-performance, S3 compatible object store.

**When to use**

MinIO is a meant to store large datasets in a cost-effective manner while making it available within and outside Deltares via a standard interface. It is a good use case if you want to collaborate on data with external parties and/or want to run computational workflows using a mixture of on-premise / public cloud / external HPC compute facilities while maintaining the data within our own on-premise data infrastructure.

**How to use**

**How to get started**

Go to [Surf Filesender](https://www.surf.nl/diensten/surffilesender) and log in using your Deltares credentials.

**Limitations**

Collaboration is possible with colleagues and authorized students within and outside the Deltares network but access needs to be individually controlled by the permission holder.

**TRL**

Medium. See [LINK](/storage-finder/trl) for more information on Technology Readiness Levels (TRL).
