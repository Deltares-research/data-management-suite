**Description**

SURF Filesender makes it possible to safely send (large) files to external parties using your Deltares e-mail address and network password. This service can be used by every Deltares employee. It is presented by the SURF organisation.

**When to use**

If you want to transport large files to an external party once. 

**How to use**
For the SURF Filesender we can add that you can not only send large amount of data to external parties, but you can also receive large amount of data sent by external data (up to 1 TB). You can do that by providing the external party with an SURF Filesender voucher. Tip from ICT Helpdesk when using this is to zip the data in 1 or more zipfiles. The transfer will be faster and you can easily check if all files has been transfered.
