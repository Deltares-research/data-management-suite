**Description of functionality**

Geoserver is so called middleware. It acts as a broker for several types of spatial data between storage component and ‘users’. Often users are geo web applications or GIS applications. Geoserver converts a specific set spatial data formats to globally accepted OGC standards for data exchange via so called RESTFull Interfaces.

**When to use**

Typically, Geoserver is used to share spatial data with external users and is often used as means to serve spatial data and spatial information for reuse in geoweb applications and/or automated processes.

**How to use**

Geoserver is made available via DPC (Deltares Private Cloud) as a service with a default amount of data storage (10Tb, which can be extended). Geoserver is a service with a user interface where administration of layers, styles and users are provided. Start with installing Geoserver on your local machine (for more information see [https://geoserver.org/](https://geoserver.org/)).

**How to get started**

Create a Topdesk call to request of geoserver. Best is to get in contact with data stewards for this.  
On e-learning platform of Deltares a general introduction of use of Geoserverin projects is available.

**Limitations**

Virtually no limitations with respect to hardware, memory usage and disk storage. There are numerous applications where geoserver provides end users with Gb’s (to Tb’s) of data. Configuration for specific cases (large imagery for instance) needs to be addressed via data stewards.

**Costs**

Geoserver is hosted on a linux machine which needs regular updates. X Euro per year. Further, additional data storage costs are involved of €100,- TB/month.
