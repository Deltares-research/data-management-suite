TDS provides students, educators and researchers with coherent access to a large collection of real-time and archived datasets from a variety of environmental data sources at a number of distributed server sites. The THREDDS Data Server (TDS) is a web server that provides metadata and data access for scientific datasets, using a variety of remote data access protocols (of which OGC WMS, OGC WCS and OGC CSW).

**When to use**

Use with large datasets of structured and unstructured ‘gridded’ datasets that are either archived or still dynamically updated.

**How to use**

There is a wide variety of usage. It is very suited to be used in data acquisition of gridded data sources.

Most eloquent usage is for RWS in case of Jarkus data that is used in modelling. From 2010 until now periodic updates of data is made available via [TDS of Deltares](https://opendap.deltares.nl/thredds/catalog/opendap/rijkswaterstaat/jarkus/grids/catalog.html).

**How to get started**

Make a topdesk call for request of a new folder in the current TDS of Deltares. Otherwise get in contact with your data steward.
