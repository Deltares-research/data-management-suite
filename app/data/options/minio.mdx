**Description**

MinIO is cloud storage service that is available on the Deltares private cloud and can be leveraged to share data with external parties / compute locations. MinIO offers a high-performance, S3 compatible object store.

**When to use**

MinIO is a meant to store large datasets in a cost-effective manner while making it available within and outside Deltares via a standard interface. It is a good use case if you want to collaborate on data with external parties and/or want to run computational workflows using a mixture of on-premise / public cloud / external HPC compute facilities while maintaining the data within our own on-premise data infrastructure.

**How to use**

MinIO consists of two separate components, namely the web interface and the API interface.

Using the web interface (s3-console.deltares.nl) you can upload/download data using the user interface provided. This interface is only accessible via the Deltares campus network or via a VPN connection. In this interface "s3-console" the projectleader can generate user-keys and access-keys for external users. External users only have access through the API interface.

Using the API interface (s3.deltares.nl) you can access your data set via standard libraries like Boto3 (for Python). This interface is accessible from every location.

**How to get started**

**Limitations**

Collaboration is possible with colleagues and authorized students within and outside the Deltares network but access needs to be individually controlled by the permission holder.

**Confidentiality classification**

This solution may store data with default confidentiality classification level: __confidential__. For demotion of the confidentiality classification level, it is mandatory to move the data to another, more suitable device.

**TRL**

High. See [LINK](/storage-finder/trl)  for more information on Technology Readiness Levels (TRL).
