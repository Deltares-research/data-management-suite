**Description**

MinIO is cloud storage service that is available on the Deltares private cloud and can be leveraged to share data with external parties / compute locations. MinIO offers a high-performance, S3 compatible object store.

**When to use**

MinIO is a meant to store large datasets in a cost-effective manner while making it available within and outside Deltares via a standard interface. It is a good use case if you want to collaborate on data with external parties and/or want to run computational workflows using a mixture of on-premise / public cloud / external HPC compute facilities while maintaining the data within our own on-premise data infrastructure.

**How to use**

MinIO consists of two separate components, namely the web interface and the API interface.

Using the web interface (s3-console.deltares.nl) you can upload/download data using the user interface provided.

Using the API interface (s3.deltares.nl) you can access your data set via standard libraries like Boto3 (for Python). Applications like for example Teamcity allow you to directly integrate with MinIO using the API interface as well.

**How to get started**

Contact your Data Steward in your unit.

**Limitations**

Collaboration is possible with colleagues and authorized students within and outside the Deltares network but access needs to be individually controlled by the permission holder.
