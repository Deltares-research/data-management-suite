Basic Storage is a storage solution for storing large amounts of data on the Deltares campus. It is possible to access the storage via either P:<project nr> while the project is active or when archived in read-only mode P:\ArchivedProjects<project nr>.

## When to use 

In case it is necessary to store other data than project related documents, presentations and legal documents it is advised to request for a P drive.

## How to use

Usage of P drive is very diverse. Most low level is using common windows tools (i.e. Explorer, Total Commander). The environment can easily be accessed via scripting. In all situations counts that you only have access to the P drive when connected to the Deltares HDW Network (either directly or via VPN). It is possible to have a restrictive folder (you can arrange that here).
